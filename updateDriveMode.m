    % Send updated control modes over serial. This is done by
    % first converting the int to a string and then adding a
    % terminating non-numeric string character.
    
    % External Variables
    % @ s                   - Serial object.
    % @ jointVel            - Vector of joint velocites to be sent
    %                   to each motor in rad/s.
