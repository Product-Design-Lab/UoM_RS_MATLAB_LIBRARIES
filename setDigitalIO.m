    % Read motor position by sending a position read command to the
    % Arduino and then calling the readSerial() function to receive
    % the data.
    
    % External Variables
    % @ s                   - Serial object.
    % @ state           - State of the pin to be set.
    
    % Internal Functions
    % @ readSerial()        - Read data sent by Arduino over serial.
