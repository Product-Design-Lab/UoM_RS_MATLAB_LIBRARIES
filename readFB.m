    % Arduino and then calling the readSerial() function to receive
    % the data.
    
    % External Variables
    % @ s                   - Serial object.
    % @ numMotors           - Number of motors expected to read from.
    
    % Internal Functions
    % @ readSerial()        - Read data sent by Arduino over serial.
